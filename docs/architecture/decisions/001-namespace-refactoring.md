## Context

The ClassMetrix `MethodsExtractor` had grown into a complex **227-line monolithic class** that violated multiple SOLID principles and was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. The class contained all method extraction logic embedded within 15+ private methods, making it hard to test, understand, and extend.

### Original Monolithic Structure

The original `methods_extractor.rb` was a single file containing all extraction responsibilities:

```ruby
# Original methods_extractor.rb - 227 lines of complex logic
require_relative "../processors/value_processor"

module ClassMetrix
  class MethodsExtractor
    # Single class handling ALL extraction responsibilities
    def initialize(classes, filters, handle_errors, options = {})
      # Constructor logic
    end

    def extract
      # Main orchestration with embedded logic
      method_names = get_all_class_method_names
      method_names = apply_filters(method_names)
      headers = build_headers
      rows = build_rows(method_names)
      { headers: headers, rows: rows }
    end

    private

    # 15+ private methods handling different concerns without separation:
    def get_all_class_method_names         # 15 lines - Method collection logic
    def get_comprehensive_methods(klass)   # 9 lines - Method resolution logic
    def get_inherited_methods(klass)       # 12 lines - Inheritance handling
    def get_module_methods(klass)          # 15 lines - Module method extraction
    def apply_filters(method_names)        # 15 lines - Filtering logic
    def call_class_method(klass, method)   # 12 lines - Method invocation
    def find_method_source(klass, method)  # 20 lines - Source resolution
    def find_inherited_method(...)         # 15 lines - Inheritance resolution
    def find_module_method(...)            # 18 lines - Module resolution
    def determine_module_source(...)       # 6 lines - Module source logic
    def build_method_info(...)             # 5 lines - Method info construction
    # ... plus 4 more utility methods
  end
end
```

### Complexity Analysis

**Quantitative Metrics:**

- **Total Lines**: 227 lines in a single monolithic class
- **Private Methods**: 15+ methods handling different concerns
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: High due to nested conditionals and loops
- **Class Responsibilities**: 5+ distinct responsibilities in one class
- **External Dependencies**: Only 1 (`value_processor`)
- **Method Length**: Several methods exceeding 15+ lines with complex logic

**Critical Complexity Issues:**

- **Single Responsibility Violation**: One class handling collection, filtering, resolution, invocation, and formatting
- **Deep Conditional Nesting**: Multiple levels of if/while statements for inheritance and module handling
- **Tight Coupling**: All extraction concerns tightly coupled within private methods
- **Testing Difficulties**: Impossible to test individual extraction components in isolation
- **Code Duplication**: Similar patterns scattered across multiple private methods
- **High Cognitive Load**: Developers needed to understand entire 227-line context for any change

### Problems Identified

1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Single 227-line class handling 5+ distinct responsibilities
2. **Single Responsibility Violation**: One class managing method collection, inheritance logic, module handling, filtering, and invocation
3. **Testing Complexity**: Large monolithic class made unit testing individual components nearly impossible
4. **Maintenance Overhead**: Changes required understanding the entire 227-line class context
5. **Code Reusability**: Tightly coupled logic prevented reusing individual extraction components
6. **Onboarding Difficulty**: New team members struggled with the complex 15+ method interdependencies
7. **Debugging Challenges**: Issues in one area could affect unrelated functionality
8. **Extension Limitations**: Adding new extraction features required modifying the monolithic class

### The Refactoring Trigger Point

The decision to refactor was triggered when:

- **Code Reviews** were taking excessive time due to the complex class structure
- **Bug Fixes** in one area were causing regressions in unrelated functionality
- **Unit Testing** individual components was nearly impossible
- **New Feature Development** required understanding the entire 227-line class
- **Team Velocity** was decreasing due to the maintenance burden

## Decision

We decided to extract the monolithic `MethodsExtractor` into specialized service classes organized within a hierarchical namespace structure that follows Ruby best practices for module organization.

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Service Extraction**: Break down the 227-line monolithic class into focused, single-responsibility service classes
2. **Hierarchical Namespace Structure**: Organize services into logical groups within a proper module hierarchy
3. **Service Categorization**: Group services by their primary responsibility:
   - `Collection`: Services that gather methods from classes (`MethodCollectionService`, `InheritanceCollector`, `ModuleCollector`)
   - `Filtering`: Services that filter method lists (`MethodFilterService`)
   - `Resolution`: Services that resolve method sources and locations (`MethodResolver`, `InheritedMethodResolver`, `ModuleMethodResolver`)
   - `Invocation`: Services that handle method calling (`MethodCallService`)
4. **Index Files**: Create namespace index files to manage requires cleanly
5. **Proper Module Namespacing**: Move all extractors into `ClassMetrix::Extractors` namespace
6. **Single Responsibility**: Each service class handles exactly one extraction concern

### Service Extraction Strategy

**From Original Private Methods to Services:**

| Original Private Method(s)                                | Extracted Service         | Responsibility                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `get_all_class_method_names`, `get_comprehensive_methods` | `MethodCollectionService` | Collect methods from classes         |
| `get_inherited_methods`                                   | `InheritanceCollector`    | Handle inheritance method collection |
| `get_module_methods`, `get_all_singleton_modules`         | `ModuleCollector`         | Handle module method collection      |
| `apply_filters`                                           | `MethodFilterService`     | Filter method lists                  |
| `call_class_method`, `call_method`                        | `MethodCallService`       | Handle method invocation             |
| `find_method_source`                                      | `MethodResolver`          | Resolve method sources               |
| `find_inherited_method`                                   | `InheritedMethodResolver` | Resolve inherited method sources     |
| `find_module_method`, `determine_module_source`           | `ModuleMethodResolver`    | Resolve module method sources        |

## Implementation

### New Directory Structure

```

├── collection/
│   ├── method_collection_service.rb
│   ├── inheritance_collector.rb
│   └── module_collector.rb
├── filtering/
│   └── method_filter_service.rb

```

### New Namespace Hierarchy

```ruby
module ClassMetrix
  module Extractors
    module Services
      module Collection
        class MethodCollectionService
        class InheritanceCollector
        class ModuleCollector
      end
      module Filtering
        class MethodFilterService
      end
      module Resolution
        class MethodResolver
        class InheritedMethodResolver
        class ModuleMethodResolver
      end
      class MethodCallService
    end
  end
end
```

### Refactored Architecture

**Before: Monolithic Structure**

```ruby
# Single 227-line file with embedded logic
require_relative "../processors/value_processor"

module ClassMetrix
  class MethodsExtractor
    # All 15+ private methods embedded here
    # No separation of concerns
    # Tightly coupled logic
  end
end
```

**After: Service-Oriented Architecture**

```ruby
# Clean 64-line orchestrator
require_relative "services/collection"
require_relative "services/filtering"
require_relative "services/resolution"
require_relative "services/method_call_service"

module ClassMetrix
  module Extractors
    class MethodsExtractor
      def initialize(classes, filters, handle_errors, options = {})
        @method_collection_service = Services::Collection::MethodCollectionService.new(options)
        @method_filter_service = Services::Filtering::MethodFilterService.new(filters)
        @method_call_service = Services::MethodCallService.new(handle_errors, options)
        # Clear delegation to specialized services
      end

      def extract
        return empty_result if @classes.empty?
        method_names = collect_and_filter_methods
        { headers: build_headers, rows: build_rows(method_names) }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Dramatic Complexity Reduction**: From 227-line monolith to 64-line orchestrator (72% reduction)
2. **Single Responsibility Achievement**: Each service class now has one clear, focused purpose
3. **Improved Testability**: Individual service components can now be tested in isolation
4. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one extraction concern don't affect others
5. **Enhanced Readability**: Clear service boundaries make the codebase easier to understand
6. **Simplified Dependencies**: Clean separation reduces coupling between extraction concerns
7. **Better Scalability**: Easy to add new extraction capabilities without modifying existing services
8. **Ruby Best Practices**: Follows conventional Ruby service patterns and module organization
9. **No Breaking Changes**: Public API remains unchanged, preserving backward compatibility
10. **Developer Velocity**: Faster development due to focused, understandable components

### Quantitative Improvements

**Code Organization:**

- **File Size Reduction**: From 227-line monolith to 64-line orchestrator (72% reduction)
- **Service Separation**: 15+ private methods organized into 8 focused service classes
- **Directory Structure**: From 1 monolithic file to organized service hierarchy
- **Namespace Depth**: Clear 3-level namespace hierarchy (`ClassMetrix::Extractors::Services`)
- **Lines of Code Distribution**: 395 total lines properly distributed across logical services

**Maintainability Metrics:**

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service class handles exactly one extraction concern
- **Unit Testing**: Individual components can now be tested in complete isolation
- **Code Reusability**: Services can be used independently in different contexts
- **Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific service boundaries
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained 83.83% line coverage through refactoring
- **Code Reviews**: Smaller, focused classes are easier to review and understand

**Development Efficiency:**

- **Require Statements**: Only 4 clean requires instead of embedded complexity
- **Service Discovery**: New functionality can be immediately categorized into logical groups
- **Onboarding**: New developers can understand individual services without grasping entire system
- **Feature Development**: New extraction features can be added without touching existing logic

### Potential Negative

1. **Initial Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn the new service-oriented structure
2. **More Files**: 8 service files + 3 index files instead of 1 monolithic file
3. **Service Coordination**: Need to understand how services interact for complex changes
4. **Slightly More Complex Setup**: Service instantiation requires more initial setup code

### Risk Mitigation

**Learning Curve**:

- Clear documentation provided in this ADR with service responsibility mapping
- Logical service structure follows Ruby conventions and single responsibility principle
- Service names clearly indicate their purpose (Collection, Filtering, Resolution)

**File Management**:

- Well-organized directory structure with clear namespace hierarchy
- Index files provide clean entry points for each service category
- Automated testing ensures service integration remains functional

**Service Coordination**:

- Clear interfaces between services minimize coordination complexity
- Services designed to be loosely coupled with well-defined boundaries
- Main extractor class handles orchestration, keeping individual services focused

### Neutral

1. **Migration Effort**: One-time refactoring effort required
2. **Documentation Updates**: Need to update documentation to reflect new structure

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Keep Monolithic Structure

**Rejected**: The 227-line class was becoming unmaintainable with too many responsibilities

**Issues:**

- Continued violation of Single Responsibility Principle
- Testing individual components remained impossible
- High cognitive load for any changes
- Debugging complexity would only increase

### 2. Extract Services but Keep Flat Structure

```ruby
# Example: All services in same directory without namespacing
require_relative "method_collection_service"
require_relative "method_filter_service"
# ... 8 individual requires
```

**Rejected**: Would improve some issues but still create organizational problems

**Issues:**

- No logical grouping of related services
- Difficulty understanding service relationships
- Scalability issues as more services are added

### 3. Feature-Based Organization Instead of Responsibility-Based

```ruby
# Example: Group by class type being extracted rather than extraction responsibility
module Extractors
  module ClassMethods
  module InstanceMethods
```

**Rejected**: Services are shared across multiple extraction types

**Issues:**

- Would create code duplication
- Services naturally group by extraction responsibility, not target type
- Less intuitive than responsibility-based organization

### Before and After Comparison

**Original Monolithic Structure:**

- 1 file: `methods_extractor.rb` (227 lines)
- 15+ private methods handling all concerns
- High complexity, low testability
- Single responsibility violations

**New Service-Oriented Structure:**

- 1 orchestrator: `methods_extractor.rb` (64 lines)
- 8 service classes: organized by responsibility (395 lines total)
- 3 index files: clean namespace management
- Clear separation of concerns, high testability

## Future Considerations

1. **Service Addition Guidelines**: New services should be added to appropriate namespace categories based on primary responsibility
2. **Index File Maintenance**: Keep index files up to date when adding new services (automated validation recommended)
3. **Documentation**: Update any architectural documentation to reflect this structure
4. **Team Training**: Ensure team members understand the new namespace conventions and categorization logic
5. **Threshold Monitoring**: Monitor when service categories might need subdivision (recommend refactoring if any category exceeds 6-8 services)
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Track require load times as the codebase grows to ensure namespace organization remains efficient

### Success Metrics for Future Evaluation

**Quantitative Indicators:**

- New service addition time should decrease
- Code review time for service-related changes should improve
- Developer onboarding time for understanding service architecture should reduce
- Service-related bug resolution time should improve due to better organization

**Qualitative Indicators:**

- Developer feedback on codebase navigation
- Ease of understanding service relationships
- Reduced confusion about where to place new functionality
